# About

Wolfdown is a simple flat file CMS designed with players of RPGs in mind, although it could honestly be used for any small website project.

# Use

To install, simply drop the directory onto your server. PHP 5+ is the only known requirement, but it's likely to work on older versions.

To add pages, simply create a new file with a `.md` extension in the `content` folder, and it will automagically appear in the navigation. All files are [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/) compatible. You'll want to go there if you're looking for directions and syntax guides.

Use the `config.php` file to set the title and add links to the navigation.

The Home.markdown file needs to keep its extension so it doesn't show up twice in the navigation (and for other reasons). It also uses the same Markdown formatting; it simply has a different extension.

I've included the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) file for those of you who want it, but the CSS file should be more than enough for most users.

Feel free to contact me at <keto@ontheclock.us> with any questions, suggestions, or comments.
